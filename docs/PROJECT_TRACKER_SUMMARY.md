## 📋 Project Structure

### One Project, Multiple Types

**Recommendation**: ✅ Use one project (as implemented)

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth
- Easy to see all work in one place
- Can filter by Type (Feature/Bug/Idea)
- Less overhead than multiple projects
- Better cross-type visibility

### How It Works

1. **Add items** to the project
2. **Set Type** field to categorize (Feature/Bug/Idea)
3. **Set Category** for further organization
4. **Set Status** to track progress
5. **Create views** filtered by Type for easy navigation
